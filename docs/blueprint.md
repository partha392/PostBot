# **App Name**: PostBot AI Assistant

## Core Features:

- Information Retrieval: Retrieves up-to-date information about India Post services and schemes using the Gemini API tool and various web APIs. If the Gemini API tool determines that local retrieval would provide a better user experience, the information is instead extracted from the knowledge base.
- Query Classification: Classifies user queries into predefined domains (e.g., Savings & Investment Accounts, Postal Facilities) for targeted information retrieval.
- Structured Response Generation: Generates structured and concise responses with clear headings, bullet points, and source URLs.
- Comparison Table Generation: Automatically generates comparison tables for schemes based on user queries (e.g., comparing SCSS, MIS, NSC, KVP).
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with the AI assistant.
